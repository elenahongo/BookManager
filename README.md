### browser used for this test
Google Chrome Version 81.0.4044.138 (Official Build) (64-bit)

### Did you use a npm library to manage local data storage?

  I decided to build a full API to show my skills as Full Stack Developer. 
  This was accomplished with these packages: 
    Express Node module
    SQLite3
    cors
    morgan
    errorhandler
    body-parser

### Why do you think this option is the best vs alternatives?

 I have large experience using Express.js, it provides a robust set of features whit good middleware and wide popularity in the industry.

### Please explain why did you decide to use this UI Components vs alternatives?

  I have never used this library, although I have used Bootstrap, Fundation and Materialize, but I decided to follow your recommendation

### What other libraries you had to use to accomplish the project?

  Almost all the variations of Material UI
  
### What was the most difficult to accomplish? please share your experience.

  I didn't have enough time to accomplish which I would. Errorhandler and proper feedback during loadings or confirmation messages are missing.
  A complete test suit was also out of scope.

### How much time did you spend building this test?

  2 days
